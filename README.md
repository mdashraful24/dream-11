Project Name: BPL-DREAM XI

Description:
The BPL-DREAM XI app is an interactive React-based application that allows users to create a customized cricket team within a specified credit limit. Designed to simulate a real-world team selection process, the app provides users with a list of players along with their roles, countries, and bidding prices. Players can be selected up to a maximum of six, with credit constraints adding a strategic element. Users receive real-time feedback through toast notifications for every action, such as successful player selections, removal confirmations, duplicate selections, and budget limitations. This app gives cricket fans an immersive experience to strategize, manage credits, and build their dream team.
